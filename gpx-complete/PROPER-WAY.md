# 🚀 EASIEST WAY - Test Locally in 2 Minutes

## The Problem
You're right - downloading individual files is terrible. Here's the PROPER way:

---

## ✨ OPTION 1: Clone from GitHub (Recommended)

### What You Need:
- Git (comes with Mac)
- Node.js from https://nodejs.org

### Steps:

1. **Open Terminal** (press Cmd+Space, type "Terminal", press Enter)

2. **Copy and paste these commands:**

```bash
# Go to your Documents folder
cd ~/Documents

# Download the project (I'll give you a public repo link)
git clone [GITHUB_URL_HERE] gpx-diagramming

# Go into the folder
cd gpx-diagramming

# Install everything
cd server && npm install && cd ../client && npm install && cd ..

# Start the app
cd server && node server.js &
cd client && npm run dev
```

3. **Your browser will open automatically!**
   - Enter code: `gpx2026`
   - Start using it!

**Next time:** Just run the last 2 lines (start the app)

## ⚡ OPTION 2: Even Simpler - Use GitHub Desktop

This is the EASIEST for non-developers:

### Steps:

1. **Download GitHub Desktop**
   - https://desktop.github.com
   - Install it

2. **Clone Repository**
   - File → Clone Repository
   - URL tab → Paste: [GITHUB_URL_HERE]
   - Choose location: Documents
   - Click "Clone"

3. **Install & Run**
   - Open Terminal
   - Type: `cd ~/Documents/gpx-diagramming`
   - Type: `cd server && npm install && cd ../client && npm install`
   - Type: `npm run start` (from root directory)

## 🎯 What I'll Do for You

Let me create a **public GitHub repository** with all the code ready to go.

Then you can:
- Clone it in 10 seconds
- Run 2 commands
- Done!

**This is how ALL developers work - it's the standard process.**

---

## 🔄 For Future Changes

If I update the code:
1. Open GitHub Desktop (or Terminal)
2. Click "Fetch origin" or run `git pull`
3. Done - you have the latest version!

**No more individual file downloads. Ever.**

---

## 💡 Why This Way?

- ✅ **One command** gets everything
- ✅ **Standard developer workflow**
- ✅ **Easy updates** (just pull changes)
- ✅ **Works everywhere** (Mac, Windows, Linux)
- ✅ **Never lose files** (all in Git)

---

## Would you like me to:

**A)** Create a public GitHub repo you can clone immediately?

**B)** Give you a Netlify deploy button (one-click deployment)?

**C)** Create a CodeSandbox link (runs in browser, no install)?

Let me know and I'll set it up right now!

The downloading-files approach was my mistake - this is the proper way. 🙏
